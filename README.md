# Phylogenomic analysis
 
 Phylogenomic analysis workflow (Trim Galore!, SPAdes, QUAST, Geneious, Gblocks, IQ-TREE, FigTree and Inkscape) for post-processing MiSeq raw reads.
  
 Workflow is as follows:
 de novo genome assembly -> genome annotation -> alignment -> model selection & tree construction -> viewing and editing tree
