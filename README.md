# Phylogenomic analysis
 
 Phylogenomic analysis workflow (Trim Galore!, SPAdes, QUAST, Geneious, Gblocks, Anaconda, IQ-TREE, FigTree and Inkscape) for post-processing antipatharian ezRAD data. (Workflow can be applied to other organisms, just note portions that pertain specifically to antipatharia).
  
 Workflow is as follows:
 de novo genome assembly -> genome annotation -> alignment -> model selection & tree construction -> view and edit tree
