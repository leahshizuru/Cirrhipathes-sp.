# Phylogenomic analysis
 
Phylogenomic analysis for antipatharian ezRAD data. Workflow can be applied to other organisms; note that certain steps (marked with *) pertain to antipatharians. Software used include the following: Trim Galore!, SPAdes, QUAST, Geneious, Gblocks, Anaconda, IQ-TREE, FigTree and Inkscape.
  
 Workflow is as follows:
 de novo genome assembly -> genome annotation -> alignment -> model selection & tree construction -> view and edit tree
