Genome Annotation for Antipatharians 

Kayal et al. 2013 selected "The Mold, Protozoan, and Coelenterate Mitochondrial Code and the Mycoplasma/Spiroplasma Code (transl_table=4)" for their annotations on GenBank. Barrett et al. 2020 utilized the following settings on Mitos2 (Bernt et al., 2013) to confirm annotations: NCBI RefSeq 81 Metazoa and genetic code 4 (mold, protozoan and coelenterate mitochondrial code).

Transferred annotations from Cirrhipathes lutkeni/Stichopathes luteni (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JX023266.1/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_018377.1) to our de novo using Geneious.

Our initial BankIt submission was rejected because the wrong genetic code was used, thus stipulating an incorrect reading frame. The second submission to BankIt was mostly correct, however it was still rejected due to COI and ND5 discrepencies. 

In order to amend the annotations we will extract COI and ND5 from Antipathes cf. dichotoma (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MT318841.1), Phanopathes sp. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MT318852.1), Stichopathes sp. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MZ157399.1)

The fasta and GFF3 files for all of the above were downloaded and put those files into a folder in Geneious. Once both documents were loaded both documents into Geneious gene annotations were visible.

In order to extract the gene of interest...
1) select gene (ND5 or CO1)
2) right click "Copy Sequence Name & Bases"
3) go to "Sequence" in the tab/drop down options
4) select "New sequence" and paste the sequence and sequence name here. (Get rid of the name as we are only interested in the bases)

Performed a multiple sequence alignment using the Geneious aligner's default settings.

Go to the Sequence View tab in Geneious to export the annotations to a .csv
