Alignment (Geneious 2022.1.1, MUSCLE/MUSCLE pluggin, Gblocks)

Mitochondrial genome alignment for antipatharians (see Barrett et al. 2020; methods that follow reflect those of Shizuru et al. 2022 in review)


#GenBank
  Download all relevant .fasta and .gff3 files from GenBank 


#Geneious Prime 2022.1.1
  
  Create a folder for each species and upload .fasta and .gff3 files to these folders
  
    in each folder:
      1) extract individual coding regions (CDS) from each species
  
      2) concatenate genes (remove intronic regions that are present in COX1 and ND5). Select "Concatenate Sequences" from the Tools menu.
  
  Perform MUSCLE alignment (with default parameters)


#Gblocks (to eliminate poorly aligned positions in MUSCLE alignment)(http://molevol.cmima.csic.es/castresana/Gblocks/Gblocks_documentation.html)
    upload MUSCLE alignment .fasta file to Gblocks and run executable


#Geneious Prime 2022.1.1 & TextEdit
  Upload output .fasta file created by Gblocks and perform a pairwise alignment with an annotated & concatenated genome to obtain partitions needed for IQ-   TREE
  
  *** You will use this pairwise alignment (and partitions observed) in IQ-TREE. However, before exporting this alignment as a .fasta file remove the annotated & concatenated sequence from the alignment. This sequence was only used to obtain the partitions. ***
  
  Export .fasta file
  
  Export alignment as a .nex file and edit this file in TextEdit to create a nexus file with partitions. (see example in repository)
