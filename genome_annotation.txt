Genome annotation (Mitos2 and Geneious Prime)

#Mitos2
Upload de novo assembly to Mitos2 (http://mitos2.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/index.py) 
*If working with antipatharian select RefSeq 89 Fungi and Genetic Code 4 (see Barrett et al. 2020)

#Geneious Prime
Final annotations for Cirrhipathes cf. anguina (Shizuru et al. 2022 in review) were carried out in Geneious Prime with the live annotate feature. 

1) Create a folder in "Reference Features" containing the gff3 and .fasta files for species that were most similar (determined by previous BLAST search post assembly). The gff3 files will have the annotations, the .fasta files will contain only the sequence.
2) Go to folder with the de novo assembly and double click the sequence to generate "Sequence View".
3) Select "Allow Editing" tab and then select the "Annotate & Predict" tab. 
4) Choose the "Annotate from Database" option. Geneious will automatically go into the folder that you created within "Reference Features".
5) You can either choose "Best match" (in Find:) or "All matching annotations". For our paper we only applied "Best match" with "Similarity: 99%"
6) Select "Apply" to transfer the annotations to your de novo assembly. Then type âŒ˜S (to save the file).
